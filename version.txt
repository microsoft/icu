# This file contains the version of ICU in the repo, which is
# primarily used for versioning pre-built binary downloads.
#
# ICU Version Number Schema:
#
# The ICU version number has 4 parts:
#   Major . Minor . Patch-level . Build-level
#
# Each of these is a uint8_t value, which gives a range of 0-255.
# 
# The upstream ICU library reserves the right to use the Major, Minor,
# and Patch-level version parts in releases, but leaves the Build-level
# part for "client" usage.
#
# We use/set the "build-level" part in order to have a consistent
# version number across different packaging mechanisms that might be
# used (Ex: VPack, Nuget, Tarball, etc.)
#
# Each time a new set of packages needs to be produced, we increment
# the build-level version number by 1.
#
# When a new version of ICU is ingested, this will update/change the
# Major and Minor versions, and we will reset the build-level version
# part back to 0.
#
# In order to keep track of what exact version of ICU was ingested,
# the variable "ICU_upstream_hash" records the SHA1 hash from the upstream
# maint/maint-* branch when a new version is ingested. This shouldn't be
# changed or modified unless a new version is being ingested.
#
# This makes it easier to tell if a post-release fix in the upstream
# maint/maint-* branch needs to be cherry-picked into this repo.
#
