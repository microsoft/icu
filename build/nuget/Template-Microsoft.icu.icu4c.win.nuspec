    <summary>Pre-built Windows binaries of ICU4C</summary>
    <description>This package contains pre-built binaries of ICU4C for Windows from the Microsoft ICU (MS-ICU) repo on GitHub.

ICU4C is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ libraries providing Unicode and Globalization support for software applications.

The MS-ICU repo contains a modified version of ICU4C with changes for security, maintenance, data changes for Microsoft usage, as well as minor changes for the Windows OS build of ICU4C.

These binaries are built using the MSVC compiler and require the VC Redist to be installed.
